Support Vector Machines: 

The support vector machine (or SVMs) is a supervised machine learning model that can be used for regression and classification problems.

The most important parameters are: 
1) "C"
2) "gamma"
3) "kernel"

The SVM model does not provide probability estimates, but they can be calculated five-fold cross-validation (see scikit-learn).

Kernel trick is a method to solve a non-linear problem using a linear classifier.
