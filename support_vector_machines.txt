Support Vector Machines: 

The support vector machine (or SVMs) is a supervised machine learning model that can be used for regression and classification problems. 

Step-by-step process: 
1) data pre processing (scale the data and create x,y)
2) train the model
3) prediction
4) classification report/confusion matrix 
5) gridsearchcv (prediction with gridsearchcv)

The most important parameters are: 
1) "C"
2) "gamma"
3) "kernel"

The SVM model does not provide probability estimates, but they can be calculated five-fold cross-validation (see scikit-learn).

Kernel trick is a method to solve a non-linear problem using a linear classifier.
